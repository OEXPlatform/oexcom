		title2:"OF THE NATIVE ASSETS",
		three: "The underlying native elements of OEX Chain are open source, which allows users to issue their own “native assets” on OEX  chain. Smart contracts are no longer required when issuing assets, but the one-click issuance by filling in the asset information on the wallet page."
	}, {
		title: "MULTI-ASSETS",
		title2:"SAFETY MECHANISM",
		four: "Contract security is not ideal for most of the smart contracts, which has triggered many security issues. OEX adopts the multi-asset security mechanism, in which the contract/token issuers will operate the assets through contract permits once the token entered into the private key address, to ensure the security of the users’ assets."
